# Timeseries-AUTH2020
Semester Project for Timeseries Course / Aristotle University of Thessaloniki / Winter Semester 2020

## Short Description of the Semester Project
Given a database with data about the daily views of a Youtube video, we want to analyze the timeseries and find significant changes in the demand of the video content (views). To do it, we use traditional methods of fitting ARIMA models to the data.


## Status of the project
As of the completion of the project, it will NOT be maintained. By no means should it ever be considered stable or safe to use, as it may contain incomplete parts, critical bugs and security vulnerabilities.
